# üçû Bakery Business Analysis ‚Äì SQL to Excel Dashboard

Welcome to the **Bakery Business Analysis** project! This project walks through the process of transforming raw transactional data from a bakery business into actionable business insights using PostgreSQL for data analysis and Microsoft Excel for creating an interactive dashboard. The analysis helps businesses make data-driven decisions by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and business opportunities.
